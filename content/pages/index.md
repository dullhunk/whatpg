          There are insufficient incentives for practitioners to publish and too many barriers to prevent publication. The mantra of “publish or perish” doesn’t apply, there are lots of good practitioners who publish very little, their work is invisible

          Good teaching does not always lead to sufficient recognition and reward. Advance HE rewards like AFHEA, FHEA, SFHEA, PFHEA and NTF help but are not always recognised by promotion panels dominated by research-focused staff

          It can be difficult to find funding for research into pedagogy, as a relatively young field there are still lots of open questions about how to teach computing, but inadequate funding to allow investigation to take place
